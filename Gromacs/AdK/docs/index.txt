Tutorial: Simulating AdK with Gromacs
=====================================

..   (magenta: α-helices, yellow: β-sheets).


Objective: Perform a MD simulation of the the enzyme adenylate kinase
(AdK) in its open conformation without a ligand bound. Simulate it in
a realistic environment (100 mM NaCl solution at :math:`T = 300` K and
:math:`P = 1` bar) and analyze its structural properties. 

For this tutorial we use Gromacs_ (version 4.5.5) to set up the
system, run the simulation, and perform analysis. The overall workflow
contains the following steps:

1. Download tutorial files and organize the work space

2. Setup

   - obtain structure 4AKE from PDB, select chain A

   - use default protonation states

   - generate topology

   - solvate in water in simulation cell (rhombic dodecahedron)

   - add NaCl ions to neutralise and final physiological concentration
     of 100 mM
   
3. Energy minimisation (EM)

4. Position restraint equilibration of solvent (MD); *NPT* (use weak
   coupling (Berendsen) schemes)

5. Equilibrium MD simulation (unrestrained, *NPT*, use Nose-Hoover and
   Parrinello-Rahman temperature and pressure coupling)

6. Analysis

   - RMSD
   - RMSF
   - opening (NMP-LID distance) 
   - radius of gyration
   - secondary structure
